Changes from previous version:
  Flask is no longer used as the web application framework. Web app has transitioned to Javascript with Python only being used for data scraping and cleaning.
  Previous web app was hosted on Pythonanywhere. Web app has been migrated to an Azure Static Web App which can be found here websiteepeyxeag574ao.azurewebsites.net
